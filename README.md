# A React (Remix), Typescript, Drizzle ORM project

This is one of the older versions of [softgata.com](https://softgata.com) which I've build in React (Typescript) using RemixJs framework (now React Router v7). It has multiple pages, some small animations and a contact form which saves data using Drizzle ORM.

The design is done in Figma.
The styling is done as a combination of BulmaCSS and TailwindCSS.

The app is dockerized and can be easily placed on a virtual machine on any cloud (just copy this repo on the VPS and run `docker-compose up -d`). 

I've moved this project to [bunjucks SSG](https://github.com/ClimenteA/bunjucks) a small typescript package I created to help me make custom static websites fast.

# React/Remix QuickStart

ðŸ“– See the [Remix docs](https://remix.run/docs) and the [Remix Vite docs](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/future/vite) for details on supported features.

## Development

Run the Vite dev server:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

## SQLITE

https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/get-started-sqlite#better-sqlite3


## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

- `build/server`
- `build/client`
