                            I am Alin Climente and I reprezent softgata.com.
                            I have been <strong>making applications since 2017</strong>.
                            Depending on the size and complexity of the project, we can increase the team from 1 to many.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I started my journey in the software development field by automating some menial tasks assigned to me at my first office job.
                            With a background in engineering (mechanics/robotics) my first instinct is to find the easiest way to do a job.
                            Some might say I'm lazy, but <strong>why work hard when you can work smart</strong>.
                            So, I automated myself out of that job by building some smart applications.
                            Since then, I'm full time on building end to end web applications (Python, Javascript, Typescript, Go).
                        </p>

                        <p>

                            I personally will respond and make sure to help you in the best way I can.
                            Remember, it costs nothing to see if we can help each other out.
                        </p>
